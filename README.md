# Skoda Used Car Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applying Machine Learning Algorithms on the ['skoda.csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/aishwaryamuthukumar/cars-dataset-audi-bmw-ford-hyundai-skoda-vw/ "skoda.csv title") dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn & scikit-learn.

<br>
<h3> Features of this dataset: </h3>

*  <b>model:</b> List of the Skoda Car models
*  <b>year:</b> When the car was made
*  <b>Price:</b> Selling/market price of the cars which is our <b>"Target Variable"</b>
*  <b>transmission:</b> Transmission adapts the output of the internal combustion engine to the drive wheels
*  <b>mileage:</b> The mileage of a vehicle is the number of miles that it can travel using one gallon or litre of fuel
*  <b>fuelType:</b> Different types of fuels a vehicle may use like Petrol, Deisel etc. which is used to provide power to the car engine.
*  <b>mpg:</b> MPG (miles per gallon), is the distance, measured in miles, that a car can travel per gallon of fuel. MPG is also the primary measurement of a car's fuel efficiency: The higher a car's MPG, the more fuel efficient it is.
*  <b>engineSize:</b> EngineSize of the cars refers to the volume of fuel and air that can be pushed through a carâ€™s cylinders and is measured in cubic centimetres (cc).

<h3> Main Objective(s): </h3>

*  Visualize the relation between various features of the dataset.
*  Evaluate basic statistical information of the numerical features
*  Explore & explain the plots used in this eda.
*  Data filtering
*  Data preprocessing and cleansing (where needed)
*  Data Aggregation/grouping
*  train data, test data
*  Performing Label Encoding or One-hot Encoding (Explaining which one is best suitable for the analysis)
*  Performing Machine Learning Algorithm- Linear Regression & Predicting the 'Price' from the test set
*  Evaluating RMSE - Root Mean Squared Error, MAE, MAPE, MSE, coefficient of determination values from the actual target variable and the predicted target variable.
* Comparing the actual and predicted target variable through visualization.

<h3> Plot(s) Used: </h3> 

* Barplot
* Scatter plot
* Regression line
* Histogram
* Distribution
* ECDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function)
